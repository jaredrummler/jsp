## Documentation Standards

### File Naming
- Use UPPERCASE for top-level documentation (e.g., `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`)
- Use lowercase with underscores for sub-documents (e.g., `content_scraper_details.md`)
- Include dates in design documents (e.g., `design_decision_2024_06_29.md`)

### Content Guidelines
- Use clear headings and subheadings
- Include diagrams where helpful (ASCII or Mermaid)
- Provide code examples for technical concepts
- Keep documentation up-to-date with implementation

### Markdown Standards
- Use ATX-style headers (`#`, `##`, etc.)
- Use fenced code blocks with language hints
- Use relative links for internal references
- Include table of contents for long documents

## Maintenance

This documentation should be updated whenever:
- New features are planned or implemented
- Architecture decisions are made or changed
- Implementation details change significantly
- New reference materials are discovered
