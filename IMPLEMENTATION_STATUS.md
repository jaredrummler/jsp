# Implementation Status

## Completed Components

### 1. OpenSeadragon Module (`src/openseadragon.py`)
- ✅ `OpenSeadragonConfig` class for managing tile source configurations
- ✅ `OpenSeadragonDetector` class with both Selenium and requests-based detection
- ✅ Multiple detection strategies (canvas element, JavaScript extraction, HTML parsing)
- ✅ Support for DZI and custom tile formats
- ✅ Comprehensive tests (`tests/test_openseadragon.py`)

### 2. Tile Manager Module (`src/tile_manager.py`)
- ✅ `TileManager` class with concurrent downloading using ThreadPoolExecutor
- ✅ `QualityMode` enum supporting HIGHEST, ALL, and SPECIFIC modes
- ✅ `ProgressCallback` protocol for CLI progress integration
- ✅ `TileInfo` dataclass for tracking tile metadata
- ✅ Retry logic with exponential backoff
- ✅ Temporary file management
- ✅ Error tracking and reporting
- ✅ Comprehensive tests (`tests/test_tile_manager.py`)

### 3. Testing Infrastructure
- ✅ Unit tests for all modules
- ✅ Test scripts for integration testing
- ✅ Mock-based testing to avoid external dependencies

## Pending Components

### 1. Stitcher Module (`src/stitcher.py`)
- ⏳ Need to implement tile stitching functionality
- ⏳ Should support multiple stitching strategies
- ⏳ Preview generation for large images

### 2. Enhanced Scraper Module (`src/scraper.py`)
- ⏳ Content detection strategies
- ⏳ Markdown conversion
- ⏳ Asset downloading

### 3. CLI Integration
- ⏳ Progress animations using `rich` or similar library
- ⏳ Command-line argument parsing
- ⏳ Configuration management

### 4. Logging Enhancement
- ⏳ Comprehensive logging throughout all modules
- ⏳ Log file management
- ⏳ Debug mode support

## Known Issues

1. **Chrome/ChromeDriver Version Mismatch**: The test environment has mismatched Chrome and ChromeDriver versions, preventing Selenium-based testing.

2. **OpenSeadragon Detection**: Need to improve detection for real JSP pages, particularly for dynamic content loading.

3. **Tile URL Pattern Discovery**: Current implementation needs better pattern detection for various OpenSeadragon configurations used by JSP.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the stitcher module to combine downloaded tiles
2. Test with real JSP URLs once Chrome/ChromeDriver issue is resolved
3. Enhance OpenSeadragon detection with more robust patterns
4. Add CLI integration with progress animations
5. Implement comprehensive logging

## Testing Notes

- All unit tests pass with mocking
- Integration testing blocked by Chrome/ChromeDriver version mismatch
- Tile manager successfully handles concurrent downloads with retry logic
- Progress callback system ready for CLI integration
